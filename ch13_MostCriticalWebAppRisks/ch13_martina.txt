Sensitive Data
Exposure:

Over the last few years, this has been the most
common impactful attack. Failure frequently compromises all
data that should have been protected.
Typically, this information includes
sensitive personal information (PII)
data such as health records, credentials, personal data, and credit cards,
which often require protection.
Rather than directly attacking crypto,
attackers steal keys, execute man-inthe-middle attacks, or steal clear text
data off the server, while in transit, or
from the user’s client, e.g. browser.
To protect:
-Identify when data is sensitive.
- Don't store important data if not need to.
- Encrypt at rest.
- Ensure strong algorithms
- Disable cache for responses that have imporant data.
- Store passwords with strong hashing.

Insufficient
Logging &
Monitoring:

Attackers rely on the lack of
monitoring and timely response to
achieve their goals without being
detected. 
Most successful attacks start with
vulnerability probing. Allowing such
probes to continue can raise the
likelihood of successful exploit to
nearly 100%.
In 2016, identifying a breach took an
average of 191 days – plenty of time
for damage to be inflicted.

- no monitoring of suspicious activity
- no logs of failed logins
-logs only stored locally
- no effective or good alerting systems
- The application is unable to detect, escalate, or alert for active
attacks in real time or near real time.
